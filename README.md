# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This Tableau project analyzes the adoption and growth of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** in the United States, focusing on both **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**.  

The dashboard provides insights into:
- Market size and growth trends of EVs
- Technological progress through electric range analysis
- Market dominance of BEVs vs. PHEVs
- Geographical and brand-based adoption patterns

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to explore the EV market using available data to answer key business questions:
1. What is the overall market size and growth trend of EVs?  
2. What is the average electric range, and what does it reveal about technological improvements?  
3. What is the market share of BEVs vs. PHEVs?  
4. Which states and manufacturers dominate EV adoption?  
5. Which EV models are the most popular among consumers?

## Key Insights
1. **Overall Distribution**
The dataset contains 150,413 EVs, out of which 77.6% are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 22.3% are Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles (PHEVs). The average electric range of vehicles is 67.83 miles.

2. **Growth Over Time**
EV adoption shows a sharp increase after 2017, reaching its peak in 2023 with over 37,000 vehicles. 

3. **Geographic Trends**
Washington State (WA) accounts for the vast majority of vehicles in this dataset (150,082 EVs), highlighting its strong adoption compared to other states.

4. **Manufacturer Insights**
Tesla dominates the EV market with 68,939 vehicles (45.8%), followed by Nissan (8.9%), Chevrolet (8%), and Ford (5%).

5. **Model Insights**
The most popular models are Tesla Model Y (18.9%) and Tesla Model 3 (18.4%), together representing over one-third of all EVs. The Nissan Leaf is the most popular non-Tesla model.

6. **CAFV Eligibility**
About 41.8% of vehicles are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) programs, 11.8% are not eligible, while 46.3% remain unknown, which could affect incentive-based policies.
